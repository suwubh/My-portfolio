            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Subhankar Satpathy </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Bhubaneswar, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at BIT Mesra, graduating in 2027.
            <br />
            Although my academic background lies in ECE, I somehow ended up communicating more with code than with circuits.
            <br />
            Over time, I have built strong skills in full-stack development, working with technologies like React, Node.js, TypeScript, REST APIs, WebSockets, and Redis.
            <br />
            
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Playing Chess (feel free to send me a bullet challenge! ðŸ˜„)
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Reading and writing Tech Blogs
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Travelling
            </li>
          </ul>
